An undergraduate student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at SWPU(SouthWest Petroleum University), Class of 2021. I am also a Student Member of CCF.

I am a member of the Supercomputing Team at SWPU, focusing on high-performance computing competitions both domestically and internationally. These competitions include ASC (ASC Student Supercomputer Challenge), CPC (China Parallel application Challenge on domestic CPU), PAC (Parallel Application Challenge), IPCC(International Parallel Computing Challenge) and PRA (Priority Research Application). 

I hope to continue working on porting and researching HPC applications during the master's period.

## Experiences

- 2022.09 - 2023.09, Student Captain of the Supercomputing Team.

  - Responsible for the HPC training within the team.

- 2023.07 - 2023.08, Co-organizer of the [HPC-PL](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bW2WEuDNiSj1WYJV2tiRTg).

## Selected Projects

- *swPCG:Multi-angle computation and memory access optimization for PCG algorithm on the New Generation Sunway Supercompute*	
  
  - This is the project for the CPC 2023. Base on the serial PCG algorithm that the organizing committee provided. I am responsible for the writing of slave core code. Various methods such as LDM space access adjustment and double buffering were adopted for acceleration. Additionally, the sub-algorithm LDU2CSR was refactored to eliminate its circular dependencies, thus making it more suitable for parallel computing.Achieve an average speedup of 22 times across 600 cases.
